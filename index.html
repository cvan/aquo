            <h2>Our beliefs</h2>
            <p>We want to create an environment where we are able to express the best of who we are. We want to work towards that. We think that the best what to go about that is to provide an environment where freedom of expression is the value.</p>

            <p>So what does that mean in terms of working and making money and providing value to others?</p>

            <p>Feelings are mutual. We don't want to work in an environment where we are constantly resisting against those who drain us. There are ways to deal with that, but what would happen if that is the premise? Let us discuss a mutual vision and take responsibilites for ourselves. Let us move towards that.</p>

            <p>Money ought to be a means to an end and not a constriction of our freedom of expression. Money ought to be a sign of our success not the success itself. The solution: open checks and balances.</p>

            <p>Vulnerability is life. No longer do we fear that we all make mistakes and it is okay to express and work on that expression. Dare greatly in what we believe and in what choose to belief. We hold that standard to all those with whom we surround ourselves.</p>

            <p>Vulnerability begets vulnerability.</p>

            <p>Courage is contagious.</p>

            <p>Best form of self expression is to do it out in the open.</p>

            <p>Open means open communication. All dealings are public, open, and transparent. We want to own up to and take responsibility for our actions and dealings. No mistake is great. Forgiveness is free. We are all human.</p>

            <p>The values we strive towards for ourselves and those around us:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Empathy.</b> We all bare different lenses, the cornerstone of understanding and acceptance.</li>
                <li><b>Evolution.</b> We are all destined to fit in to the larger picture and be our best selves.</li>
                <li><b>Engagement.</b> We have the freedom to pursue self expression.</li>
                <li><b>Compassion.</b> We are all in it together.</li>
                <li><b>Joy.</b> We appreciate. We acknowledge. We play. We adventure.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We are open.</p>

            <p>We are aquo.</p>
